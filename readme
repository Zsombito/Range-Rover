The RangeRover is a prototype Mars Rover inspired by NASA’s Perseverance. 
It was developed as a university project for the 2nd year Electronic and Information Engineering course at Imperial College London.
It’s objective is to serve as a prototype and as a model for the behaviour of a rover surveying alien colonies on Mars.

It needed the following capabilities:

Remote control and data submission via communication to a website hosted on the cloud
Sophisticated computer vision responsible for detecting bodies and objects with specific textures
A fully functioning mechanical drive system with a multi-looped PID controller
A local master-slave network using a microcontroller to command the other subsystems and peripherals
An energy subsystem involving charging, solar panel characterization, other analog systems.
A radar subsystem capable of detecting range of rotating metal fans and also direction, used to detect moving mechanical systems on the model planet.

These were successfully developed and can be seen within the repository.
